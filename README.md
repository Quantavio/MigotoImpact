# MultiOpen: Multi Process Opener

## How to Use

1. Open `MultiOpen.exe`.
2. Select the locations of both 3dmigoto and Genshin Impact.
3. Run your mods without worrying about getting banned! The built-in bypass ensures safety.
4. Make sure to keep the ini file with the `multiopen.exe` process
5. Bypass only works for Genshin Impact since it's my main focus.

## FAQ

Mostly because I don't want miHoYo sending me a DMCA takedown

<summary><span style="color: red;">Why does it say "Unable to open d3dx.ini"?</span></summary>
<br>
This is a known issue. If it happens, just reopen the program and it should work.
